# Olist Recommender System Analysis

This project focuses on developing a framework for **REF Analysis** as part of an e-commerce recommender system project. The analysis leverages data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for improving customer experience.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a robust analytical framework for an e-commerce dataset to derive actionable insights and build a recommender system.

## Features of the Analysis

- Data cleaning, merging, and preparation.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Machine learning modeling for building a recommender system.
- Implementation of key frameworks for analyzing customer behavior and product recommendations.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.
- **datetime**: For date-time manipulation.

## File Structure

- **E-Commerce Data Set.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and implementation.
- **data/**: Folder (not included in this repo) for storing input datasets (to be added by the user).
- **output/**: Folder for storing output files and visualizations (if applicable).

## Results

The notebook includes:
- Insightful visualizations showing trends and patterns in customer behavior.
- Models for recommending products based on customer preferences and purchase history.
- Discussion of results and potential improvements.
